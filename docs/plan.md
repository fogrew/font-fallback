# Font Fallback Generator — Implementation Plan

Static Astro site that generates metric-adjusted fallback font stacks for web fonts,
per target OS/browser audience, with live preview and live layout-shift (CLS) estimation.

Inspired by:
- [screenspan.net/fallback](https://screenspan.net/fallback) — upload a font, tune descriptors, overlay preview.
- [abacktools font fallback stack generator](https://abacktools.com/tools/design/font-tools/font-fallback-stack-generator) — curated stack presets per category.
- [cssfontstack.com](https://cssfontstack.com/) — font availability per OS.

## 1. Product scope

### 1.1 Inputs (web fonts)
The default entry point is choosing fonts (upload / catalog). Arriving from the bookmarklet is a secondary path and is not emphasized on the first screen.

Delivered incrementally:
1. **File upload** (woff2/woff/ttf/otf) — fully local, no network. First to ship.
2. **Google Fonts picker** — catalog JSON generated at build time; font files fetched from `fonts.gstatic.com` (CORS-enabled).
3. **Site import** — hosting is static (no proxy), so:
   - **Bookmarklet** run on the user's site: collects `@font-face` rules, `document.fonts`, computed `font-family` of key elements (`body`, `h1–h3`, buttons), real text samples and element boxes, fetches same-origin font files, then opens the generator in a new tab and hands the payload over (`window.open` + `postMessage` handshake; clipboard JSON as a fallback). The user lands directly in the tuning UI with their site's fonts, text and structure preloaded for the preview and CLS simulation.
   - **Direct URL fetch** attempted from the browser; works only when the site sends CORS headers (font files usually do, HTML/CSS usually don't). Failure falls back to the bookmarklet with a clear explanation.
   - **Paste CSS** (`@font-face` blocks / Google Fonts `<link>` URL).

### 1.2 Audience (OS & browsers)
- **Browserslist editor** in the browser with presets: `baseline widely available`, `baseline newly available`, `baseline 20XX`, `defaults`, `> 0.5%, last 2 versions`, mobile-only, desktop-only; free-form query with validation and live resolved list.
- Resolved browsers are mapped to **OS groups**: `ios_saf` → iOS, `safari` → macOS, `and_chr`/`samsung`/`and_ff`/`and_uc` → Android, `chrome`/`edge`/`firefox`/`opera` → Windows/macOS/Linux/ChromeOS (desktop split is configurable).
- **My stats**: load `browserslist-stats.json` from the user's analytics (see 2.3) to use `in my stats` queries and traffic-weighted coverage.
- **Manual mode**: user adds/removes OS groups and versions directly, ignoring browserslist.
- The audience drives: which per-OS fallback selectors are shown, descriptor support warnings, and coverage estimates.

### 1.3 Per-OS fallback selection
- One column/selector per OS group. Each lists fonts preinstalled on that OS (from our dataset), **ranked by metric similarity** to the web font (x-width avg, cap height, x-height, ascent/descent ratios) with an "auto-pick best" default.
- Multiple fallbacks per OS allowed (ordered).
- **Stack resolver**: simulates, per OS, which `local()` face wins given the final `font-family` order (e.g. Arial also exists on macOS, so the macOS pick must come before Arial). Shows conflicts and proposes a reordering.
- `local()` name variants (full name + PostScript name) emitted per font, since naming differs across OSes.

### 1.4 Auto-fit (every number has auto + manual override)
Every numeric control = slider + number input + "auto" toggle. Auto values recompute when inputs change; manual edits pin the value until reset.

| Value | Auto-fit method |
|---|---|
| `size-adjust` | Ratio of weighted average glyph width (language-specific letter frequencies, per script) of web font vs fallback; optional exact fit against the preview text by measuring rendered width. |
| `ascent-override` / `descent-override` / `line-gap-override` | Web font vertical metrics (hhea/OS2 selected by an explicit engine policy) divided by the web font's own `unitsPerEm` and `size-adjust`. |
| `letter-spacing` / `word-spacing` | Numeric optimizer minimizing line-break mismatches and block height delta on sample text across chosen viewports. Emitted as a "fonts loading" CSS class + Font Loading API snippet (these are not `@font-face` descriptors). |
| `font-size-adjust` | Computed from x-height/cap-height ratio; offered as the Safari strategy (see 1.6). |
| Global "Optimize for CLS" | Runs the solver over all pinned/unpinned values to minimize simulated CLS. |

### 1.5 `unicode-range`
Both modes:
- **(a) Coverage-limited fallback**: extract the web font's cmap, emit a compact `unicode-range` for each adjusted fallback `@font-face`, so metric overrides apply only to characters the web font actually covers.
- **(b) Per-script fallback chains**: Latin / Cyrillic / Greek / CJK / Arabic / … each get their own fallback font per OS and their own adjusted `@font-face` with the script's range and per-script fit (Capsize-style per-subset x-width).
- Range compaction (merge adjacent code points, named presets matching Google Fonts subsets).

### 1.6 Impact & diagnostics (shown live, included in export)
- **Layout shift (CLS) simulation**, updated live while sliders move (debounced to animation frames):
  - Preview document rendered in hidden same-origin iframes at preset viewports (360 / 768 / 1280 / custom).
  - Element boxes collected with fallback vs web font, layout shift score computed per the Layout Instability spec (impact fraction × distance fraction).
  - Shows score per viewport with Good / Needs improvement / Poor rating (0.1 / 0.25 thresholds), plus line-count delta, block height delta, width delta %, line-break mismatches.
  - If imported via bookmarklet, uses the site's real text and structure.
- **Descriptor support matrix** for the selected audience (MDN BCD data). Notably Safari/iOS do not support `ascent-override` / `descent-override` / `line-gap-override` (only `size-adjust` from 17), so the tool shows the expected residual shift there and offers the `font-size-adjust` + fixed `line-height` strategy.
- **Coverage estimate**: share of the audience whose OS has each fallback preinstalled (usage from browserslist/caniuse data × OS availability dataset).
- **Loading strategy guidance**: `font-display` choice and its effect on CLS (`optional` = no swap shift), `<link rel="preload" … crossorigin>`, font file size, FOUT/FOIT trade-offs.

### 1.7 Outputs
- Plain CSS (`@font-face` + `font-family`), CSS custom properties variant.
- Tailwind v4 `@theme`, Next.js `next/font/local` (`declarations`, `adjustFontFallback: false` + manual fallback), Fontaine / Nuxt Fonts config, Astro Fonts config.
- Font Loading API snippet for the "fonts loading" class.
- Preload `<link>` tags.
- Machine-readable JSON (all inputs, computed metrics, outputs).
- Impact report (Markdown): CLS per viewport, support matrix, coverage, warnings.
- Share link: state serialized into URL hash (uploaded font files are kept in IndexedDB locally; link warns they are not shared).

### 1.8 Other pages
- **Font catalog** (cssfontstack analog): table of system fonts × OS/versions with availability and estimated audience coverage; static page per font with metrics and specimen.
- **Presets** (abacktools analog): curated stacks per category (sans, serif, mono, display, handwriting, system-ui, modern-font-stacks families), each openable in the generator.
- **Guide**: how descriptors, `unicode-range` and CLS interact.
- Footer links: Credits page, source repository ([fogrew/font-fallback](https://github.com/fogrew/font-fallback)).

### 1.9 Later (backlog)
- More OFL font sources besides Google Fonts (Fontsource, Bunny Fonts, independent foundries).

## 2. Data

### 2.1 Fallback font metrics
- **[@capsizecss/metrics](https://github.com/seek-oss/capsize/tree/master/packages/metrics)** (MIT): used as a cross-check for Google Fonts and a few system fonts only. It has just `latin`/`thai` subsets and ~20 system fonts ([spike](spikes/capsize-metrics.md)).
- **Own metrics format**: per face, advances of every code point in supported scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek first) plus vertical metrics, produced by `scripts/extract-metrics.ts` from installed font files. Only metrics are committed, never font files.
- Optional in-browser enhancement: Local Font Access API (Chromium) to read the user's actual installed fallback fonts.

### 2.2 OS availability dataset (own JSON, MIT)
`fonts/<font-id>.json`: names (family, full, PostScript per OS), category, scripts covered, and `availability[os][version] = preinstalled | on-demand | optional-feature | absent`, each entry with a source link.

Seeds:
- Official vendor lists: Microsoft Learn Windows font lists, Apple "Fonts included with macOS / iOS" pages, AOSP `fonts.xml` (Apache-2.0), default font packages of Ubuntu/Fedora, ChromeOS.
- [adrg/os-font-list](https://github.com/adrg/os-font-list) (MIT, **unmaintained since Nov 2021**) — one-time import for older Windows/macOS/Linux versions, with attribution; not a dependency.
- [modern-font-stacks](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks) (CC0, active) — preset stacks and cross-check of availability.
- Validated by a schema (Valibot/Zod) and unit tests (every entry has a source, no unknown OS ids).

### 2.3 Usage data
- Browser version usage: `caniuse-lite` via `browserslist` (CC BY 4.0).
- **Own traffic stats**: the user can load a `browserslist-stats.json` ([custom usage data](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#custom-usage-data) schema) produced by `browserslist-plausible`, `browserslist-ga`, `browserslist-ga-export` or by hand. Enables `> N% in my stats` queries and weights all coverage estimates by the user's real traffic. Parsed and validated locally, never uploaded.
- Desktop OS split for desktop browsers: default from StatCounter (CC BY-SA 3.0, attributed), user-editable.
- Descriptor support: `@mdn/browser-compat-data` (CC0), compiled to a small JSON at build time.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Stack
- Astro (static output, no adapter, no server), TypeScript strict.
- Hosting: Cloudflare Workers with static assets only (no Worker script), deployed by Workers Builds from GitHub.
- Preact + `@preact/signals` for the interactive generator island (`client:load` for generator, `client:visible` elsewhere).
- Font parsing: **fontkitten** (MIT, ~93 KB gzip, woff2 included) in a **Web Worker**; we compute metrics ourselves from cmap + glyph advances ([spike](spikes/font-parsing.md)).
- `browserslist` + `baseline-browser-mapping` bundled for the browser (lazy-loaded chunk).
- i18n: Astro i18n routing (`/en/`, `/ru/`, default locale redirect) + **Paraglide JS 2** for typed, tree-shaken messages.

### 3.2 FEOD layout
[FEOD](https://fractal-oriented.tech/en/) levels: `app`, `pages`, `modules`, `common`, `global`. Imports only through each entity's root `index.ts`; direction per the [import matrix](https://fractal-oriented.tech/en/reference/import-matrix).

Astro routes live in `src/app/pages` (`srcDir: ./src/app`), which frees `src/pages` for the FEOD `pages` level; route files are thin and render page entities.

```
src/
  app/                    # Astro srcDir: routes, layouts, global styles, i18n wiring, head/meta, theme
    pages/                # thin Astro routes ([locale]/index.astro, fonts/[slug].astro, …)
    layouts/
    styles/
  pages/                  # FEOD pages level: page entities with root index.ts
    generator/            # composition of modules for the generator page
    catalog/
    presets/
    guide/
  modules/
    font-source/          # web font inputs
      upload/  google-fonts/  site-import/   # submodules
    font-metrics/         # parsing worker, metrics, cmap, script detection
    system-fonts/         # dataset access, similarity ranking, local() names
    audience/             # browserslist editor, presets, OS mapping, support matrix, coverage
    fallback-fit/         # fit math, solver, unicode-range builder, stack resolver
    layout-shift/         # CLS simulation (iframes, box diff, scoring)
    preview/              # overlay/side-by-side preview, toggles
    export/               # CSS/Tailwind/Next/Fontaine/Astro/JSON/report generators
    presets/              # curated stacks
    project-state/        # signals store, URL hash + IndexedDB persistence
  common/
    ui/                   # Button, FitField (slider+number+auto), Select, Tabs, CodeBlock, Disclosure, LiveRegion
    i18n/                 # Paraglide runtime re-exports, locale helpers
    lib/                  # math, debounce, typed worker RPC
  global/                 # env.d.ts, polyfills
data/                     # fonts/*.json, metrics/*.json, presets.json (+ schemas)
scripts/                  # extract-metrics, build-google-fonts-catalog, build-bcd-subset, i18n-add-locale
tests/e2e/
```

Pure logic (`fallback-fit`, `font-metrics`, `audience`, `layout-shift` scoring, `export`) has no UI dependency and is unit-tested in isolation.

### 3.3 i18n workflow
- `messages/en.json` is the source of truth; `ru.json` etc. typed against it by Paraglide (missing key = type error).
- `pnpm i18n:add <locale>` scaffolds the messages file, registers the locale in Paraglide settings and Astro i18n config.
- Unit test checks key parity and ICU plural forms; e2e smoke runs per locale.
- Language switcher keeps the current state (URL hash survives).

### 3.4 Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Native inputs (`<input type="range">` + linked `<input type="number">`), visible labels, units in accessible names.
- Full keyboard operation, visible focus, logical order, skip link.
- Live CLS value announced via throttled polite `aria-live` region (only on settle, not every frame).
- Light/dark via `light-dark()` and `prefers-color-scheme`, respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and `forced-colors`.
- Preview overlay is not color-only: outline/dash patterns distinguish fallback vs web font.
- `@axe-core/playwright` checks on every page in both locales and themes.

## 4. Tooling & CI

- **pnpm**, **Biome** (lint + format), **lefthook** pre-commit:
  - `biome check --staged --write` (fixes re-staged),
  - `astro check` (typecheck incl. `.astro`),
  - `feod-analyzer analyze . --fail-on warning` ([@feod/analyzer](https://fractal-oriented.tech/en/tools/feod-analyzer), MIT) + Biome `noRestrictedImports` patterns for deep imports.
- **Vitest** (unit + `fast-check` property tests for the solver and range compaction).
- **Playwright** e2e against `astro preview` (Chromium; WebKit/Firefox if available in CI image).
- lefthook `commit-msg`: commitlint (Conventional Commits). Changelog generated from commits by git-cliff into Keep a Changelog format.
- **Cloudflare Workers Builds** (no GitHub Actions): the build command runs everything, so every PR gets a check run + preview URL, and a failing check fails the deployment:
  ```
  pnpm run verify   # biome ci → astro check → feod-analyzer → vitest run → astro build → playwright test
  ```
  Deploy: `wrangler deploy` on `main`, `wrangler versions upload` (preview URL) on other branches. `wrangler.jsonc` serves `dist/` as static assets. Node pinned via `.node-version`, pnpm via the `PNPM_VERSION` build variable (the build image default may be older than `packageManager`).

## 5. Phases

Each phase ends deployable with a green PR check.

**Phase 0 — Bootstrap & spikes**
- Astro + Preact + TS strict, Biome, lefthook, Vitest, Playwright, Paraglide (EN/RU), FEOD skeleton with `index.ts` per entity.
- Cloudflare Workers Builds connected; `verify` pipeline running on PRs.
- Spikes (go/no-go):
  - Playwright in the Cloudflare build container (gVisor, Ubuntu 22.04, no root for `apt` deps).
  - `@feod/analyzer` (0.1.x): parses `.ts`/`.tsx` only, not `.astro` (see issues).
  - Done: font parsing in a worker (fontkitten, own metrics format) and `@capsizecss/metrics` coverage; results in `docs/spikes/`.

**Phase 1 — Core engine (no UI)**
- Font parsing worker, metrics model, fit math, `@font-face`/CSS generator, stack resolver.
- Unit tests against known reference outputs (Capsize/Fontaine results for e.g. Inter→Arial, Roboto→Arial).

**Phase 2 — MVP generator**
- Upload input, one fallback, FitFields with auto, overlay + side-by-side preview, CSS output, copy button, EN/RU, a11y baseline.

**Phase 3 — Audience & per-OS fallbacks**
- Browserslist editor with Baseline presets, `browserslist-stats.json` import, OS mapping, manual mode, per-OS selectors with similarity ranking, stack resolver UI, descriptor support warnings, Safari strategy.

**Phase 4 — Layout shift**
- CLS simulator, live metric per viewport, letter/word-spacing fit, "Optimize for CLS".

**Phase 5 — `unicode-range`**
- cmap extraction, coverage-limited ranges, per-script fallback chains with per-script fit.

**Phase 6 — Data & catalog**
- OS availability dataset + schema + sources, metrics extraction script, catalog pages, coverage estimates.

**Phase 7 — More inputs**
- Google Fonts picker, site import (bookmarklet, CORS attempt, paste CSS).

**Phase 8 — Presets, exports, sharing**
- Presets page, all export formats, impact report, share links, persistence.

**Phase 9 — Polish**
- Full a11y audit, performance (lazy chunks, worker), SEO/meta/OG, guide page, Credits page, README.

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Playwright browsers may not run in Cloudflare's build container (Workers Builds) | Spike in Phase 0; options: headless shell only, Chromium-only e2e, or a separate e2e check (needs a decision). |
| Build time limit / monthly build quota | Cache `node_modules` and Playwright browsers; keep e2e suite focused. |
| `@feod/analyzer` is early (0.1.x), single maintainer, prebuilt binaries without provenance, no `.astro` parsing | Kept with mitigations (#50): exact version pin, sha256 verification of the platform binary against `scripts/feod-analyzer.sha256.json`, execution with a scrubbed environment (it keeps secrets from the analyzer binary, not from the rest of the build command), own relative-path-literal check for `.astro`, Biome import restrictions as a second line. Revisit if upstream adds provenance or `.astro` support. |
| System font metrics vary by OS version | Store metrics per OS version where they differ; show "measured on" source. |
| Safari lacks vertical overrides | Explicit residual-shift estimate + `font-size-adjust` strategy. |
| No precise "% of users have font X" data exists | Estimate from OS availability × browser/OS usage; label as estimate. |

## 7. Credits
Every external source (data, libraries with notable data, inspiration sites, specs) is listed in [`CREDITS.md`](../CREDITS.md) with its license, and rendered on a Credits page of the site (linked from the footer).

## 8. Open questions
1. If Playwright cannot run in the Cloudflare build: allow a single GitHub Actions job for e2e only, or run e2e Chromium-only / locally? (resolved by the Phase 0 spike)
