# os-fonts

Which fonts ship with which operating system, as a schema-validated dataset (`data/os-fonts.json`) with a source URL on every entry. Only positive evidence is recorded: a missing entry means the version is unknown, not that the font is absent.

- `lib/model.ts`: types. `lib/validate.ts`: `validateDataset` / `assertDataset` (unit-tested, run against the bundled data).
- `lib/query.ts`: `osAvailability(font, os, dataset)` reports `preinstalled` (all known versions), `partial`, `on-demand` (Windows Feature on Demand) or `unknown`; `fontsAvailableOn` lists fonts per system.

The dataset covers a curated list of fallback-relevant families (`scripts/os-fonts/families.ts`) and is regenerated with `pnpm os-fonts:import` (network access required):

| System | Versions | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | 10, 11 | Microsoft Learn font lists |
| macOS | 10.15, current | adrg/os-font-list (MIT), Apple system fonts page |
| iOS | current | Apple system fonts page |
| Android | 10 to 16 | AOSP `fonts.xml` at release tags |
| Linux | Ubuntu 20.04 to 26.04 | desktop ISO manifests, mapped from package to families |
| ChromeOS | none yet | |

Gaps to fill: macOS 11 to the current release, ChromeOS, vendor Android builds and per-font local names.

## Metrics

`data/metrics.json` holds, per family, the vertical metrics (`hhea`, `typo`, `win`), the local names for `@font-face` `local()` and the glyph advances for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and common punctuation (code point runs plus an advance array). Only metrics are committed, never font files; each entry records the source file, its SHA-256 and, for downloads, URL and license. `osFontMetrics()` decodes them into `Uint32Array`/`Float64Array` pairs compatible with the fit engine.

`pnpm os-fonts:metrics [extra font dirs...]` regenerates the file with the production parser (`parseFontBuffer`), running it through a Vite server. It searches the system font directories (Windows `%WINDIR%\Fonts`, macOS `/System/Library/Fonts`, `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental`, `/Library/Fonts`, Linux `/usr/share/fonts`, plus the extra directories), downloads open-source fonts from pinned URLs (cached in the OS temp directory) and keeps previous entries for fonts it cannot find. Font collections use their first member. Helvetica, Helvetica Neue and Lucida Grande need a macOS run.
